#### Get the datasets [here](https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist/home) and paste them in this folder

Copy-paste info from original post:
* ~5GB of data (filtered data ~2.3GB, total folder ~9GB)
* 302,675 unique users
* 302,573 of them with some demographic data
* 80,076,112 records in anime lists
* 46,358,322 of them have ratings
* 14,478 unique anime

I have uploaded a `.db` file (~1.65GB) with the data I'll be working with, which
you can [download here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m0PfzHkJ9-6tyTIfZyFPMQ9bi3WZft1Q). 
Keep in mind that if you want to load the User-Anime Ratings Matrix you'll need ~1.6GB of 
memory, so a minimum of 6-8GB **free** RAM is suggested (so 8-12GB system total).
