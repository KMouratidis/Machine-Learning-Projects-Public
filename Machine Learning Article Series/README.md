## Machine Learning Article/Tutorial Series

This is a series of articles that is meant to introduce a non-math person into various ML algorithms, and Data Science. 
It is not meant to be a comprehensive introduction to ML, and it is not meant to cover and details.
The goal is to create **short** introductions for publication in a certain website. They are listed below, in order.
I highly advise taking (online) courses (check out [my course reviews here](https://github.com/KMouratidis/Machine-Learning-Projects-Public/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20Article%20Series/Course%20Reviews/README.md)) and reading books.
