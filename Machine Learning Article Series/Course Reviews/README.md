## Lists by institution:

### MIT OpenCourseWare (free)

#### 1) [MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2010](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi)

This is an introduction to AI, but the title of "introduction" is somewhat misleading as to the fact that it presupposes some knowledge.
You'll find a ton of information, especially on more traditional approaches to field. The most notable one is the use of "search"
algorithms (i.e. that search for solutions in a "state space"; depth/breadth first search, A-star, Beam-search, Branch-and-Bound).
The professor doesn't go into too much detail about every subject (it *is* an introduction after all). I you are interested in
implementing some of these algorithms drop me a message and I can give you an exercise I played around with (playing Freecell
Solitaire). He mentions the basic of other advanced subjects (**Neural Nets, Edge Detection -Computer vision-, Phonology,
Genetic Algorithms, Statistical/Machine Learning, Belief Nets**). It might be hard to follow some of the topics, but he stresses
the concepts more than the mathematics, so that's good. It takes about 24 hours, but you can skip (although I'd advise against)
the last 7 videos since they are not actual lectures. You can easily watch the whole series at 1.25-1.5 speed, maybe even 2x.
The professor is very passionate and has also prepared a lot of visual demonstrations.

#### 2) [MIT 6.0002 Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science, Fall 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP619EG1wp0kT-7rDE_Az5TNd)

This course is a general introduction to Data Science, and covers the most important topics like Statistics (inference and 
probability), Optimization and the basics of Machine Learning. Again, it is more focused on a few key ideas.
It will walk you through some examples, and will focus on solving problems with code rather than math (which I believe is the
best approach). Both professors are excellent and most lectures are quite fun to watch.

### Coursera (free / paid)

#### 1) [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

Machine Learning by Andrew Ng is maybe the most popular Machine Learning introduction course out there. As with most of the previous
courses, I breezed through the lectures quickly (again, 1.5x is easy to do for anyone). It goes into the mathematics, but doesn't
get bogged down. He shows a bit of code, but the languages that he's using are MATLAB and Octave. The first is popular (and paid),
but the second is not really used by Data Scientists (everyone goes with Python or R).  This still covers a wide variety of topics
and Andrew Ng is a *great* professor (also cofounder of Coursera).

#### 2) [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

That is not the case for Andrew Ng's Deep Learning course. I took this specialization (4 courses at the time, now 5) about 9 months
ago, and I have to say it is probably the best introduction to Deep Learning. It has graded exercises if you opt for the verified
track (~$40-50 per month), which I suggest doing, and great lectures. The professor goes into much detail but doesn't get bogged down
in neither the mathematics (not too much to begin with) nor the coding (that's where the exercises come in). The coding part of
Neural Nets is hard, but this is not the case for this course since there are many prompts (too many, to be honest) in the exercises,
and thus you know what you have to do (some bugs when I first completed it, but they'll probably have been fixed by now).
Overall, I cannot recommend this specialization enough. There are lots of people who successfully completed it. When it comes
to time, back then it took me less than a month for the 4 courses. Experienced people in Deep Learning that only did the exercises
could finish one course per day (I assume they also had jobs). I don't recommend rushing it. Contrary to what I did at the time,
I insist you take your time and read some papers and complementary material, just to get a better view of the field.

#### 3) [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning)

This 3-course specialization is taught by different Imperial College professors each focusing on a different subject: Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, PCA - all necessary for Data Science / Machine Learning. All three courses have lectures and exercises, and all three professors are great, the explanations are clear and consise. You also get a *cheatsheet for every course* that includes the basic concepts and formulas. Take note, this is a math course and (as it to be expected) you will have to read formulas, but it is an applied course which means that instead of solving exercises on paper you write code; **quizzes require coding**. If you don't have a background in math, these may be considered as medium difficulty. A 1-1.25x is a good speed, at least if you want to also take hand notes (which I highly suggest you do).

The first course is taught by David Dye and touches on the subject of Linear Algebra. It begins by explaining vectors, vector products, and then moves to coordinate systems, change of bases, matrices, introduction to some notation, eigenand everything else you would expect in a Linear Algebra introductory course. The fifth week focuses on eigenvectors and is taught by Samuel Cooper who also teaches the second course. I found his pace easier to follow, and is (slightly) more energetic. In the course he focuses on Multivariate Calculus. He has some neat visualizations throughout and some fun games (e.g. 'The Sandpit') which help you understand how optimization works. Concepts like derivatives, hessians, the chain rule, are well explained and you are also introduced to function approximation with Talor Series, constrained optimization, and Gradient Descent. In the final week, David Dye returns to teach us about Linear Regression, and after completing the programming assignment you can boast having solid enough foundations. Finally, the third course is about performing Principal Component Analysis, and is taught by Marc Deisenroth. In the first three (out of four) weeks, he presents from scratch all of the concepts necessary: mean, variance, covariance, vectors/matrix products, projections, everything you are supposed to know after completing the second course. His style is more strictly focused on the mathematics. Frankly, I found this an unnecessary repetition, but for someone else it might be a great quick review, use your discretion. It is the fourth and final week where you actually go into the PCA, where I found the programming assignment to be just sufficiently hard to ensure you know what you're doing.

#### 4) [Data Science Math Skills](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills/)

Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus are not the only topics you need to cover. In fact, if your mathematics background is relative week, I'd advise starting here before the *Mathematics for Machine Learning* specialization. This is only a single course but the breadth of topics covered make it a must-take. You'll learn about Sets, notation, some basic algebra, the coordinate system, functions, tangents and derivatives, exponents and logarithms, and some even statistics (probabilities, permutations, combinations, Bayes' theorem). It has simple quizzes, and it is easy to complete in a day or two (speed-wise: 1.5-2x).

#### 5) [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)

Python for Everybody is a 5-course specialization offered by the University of Michigan and taught by Charles Severance, yet another great professor. This was my first serious attempt (I had tried some other sources previously with no success) at learning python and I was not dissapointed. Having virtually zero background knowledge in programming, this was the best introduction on the subject. You get lectures, exercises, concepts, all in a well-formatted and easily digestible manner spaced across ~23 weeks (+6 for the capstone which I didn't take). What really helped me solidify my knowledge was following a certain learning process: read the slides, watch the lectures, read the book chapter (yes, it has a very well-written **free book** to accompany the course), which of course you can do in any order. This was extremely useful; a quick overview, a lecture with better explanation, and then a detailed overview of the topic. This specialization will walk you through all the steps you need to take to get started. A few words about what programming is and why we do it (this is not an introduction to Computer Science though, take a look at Harvard's introduction to C.S. for that), setting up a Python environment, variables, expressions, functions, control flow (if-else, loops), data types (strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples), useful packages (dealing with regular expressions, scrapping, networking, data handling), and finally some slightly more advanced concepts like the SQL language, object oriented programming, and visualization. Pair this specialization with...

#### 6) [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)

Taught by Christopher Brooks, Daniel Romero, Kevyn Collins-Thompson, and V. G. Vinod Vydiswaran, this 5-course specialization is a continuation of the previous one. This is much more advanced and if you're fresh out of the previous series this might prove a bit tough handle. The lectures are awesome and supporting material is more than enough to fill your brain. This course will semi-force you to go to documentation pages and read stuff which, if you're new to Python and Data Science, you might find hard to manage, but keep in mind that it is a necessary skill to have when programming (in fact, as you get more involved with programming later on you might need to use libraries where there is no documentation!). With searching and dedication (and StackOverflow for the harder stuff), you can complete this. On the contrary, for those with mathematics and/or statistics backgrounds and some familiriaty with programming, this series should be rather easy to complete (maybe even try going into more advanced material directly).


### YouTube

#### 1) [Crash Course Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLME-KWdxI8dcaHSzzRsNuOLXtM2Ep_C7a)

This is probably **the** best introduction to Computer Science I have come across. It covers a wide array of topics starting from the lowest possible level (current and transistors) and from there building all the way up to Machine Learning, Cryptocurrencies, and more. For those interested in Data Science here are the videos I would suggest you take a more careful look:
* Video #3, Boolean Logic & Logic Gates:
AND, OR, and NOT operations are extremely useful in your
day-to-day Data Science life. Boolean logic will help you
not only structure your conditional statements in Python
later on but also get you started on Logic Programming
which is useful for NLP (much later on).
* Videos #4-5,
Getting the gist of bits, bytes, and their addition will
help you understand why adding the GDP of China and the
US suddenly returns some seemingly random negative number.
Encoding of characters with numbers is a concept you will 
encounter again much later (if you have Python installed,
execute `ord('a')` for fun).
* Video #8, Instructions & Programs:
By explaining how CPU instructions work, Carrie Anne 
implicitely introduces you to control flow (loops, ifs).
If you're up for it, write a Python function (say 
`def func(): ...`) with a simple for loop, then run 
`from dis import dis` and `dis(func)`. Disassemblying 
a function will become a powerful tool in your arsenal for
optimizing your Python code in the future.
* Video #12-14, Programming, Algorithms, Data Structures:
It is here you're more formally introduced to programming:
variables, loops, conditionals, functions, sorting algorithms,
algorithmic complexity, data types and structures.
* Video #16, Software Engineering:
This video describes the process of creating (quality) programs
(testing, collaboration, APIs), object orientation 
* Video #19, Memory & Storage:
The key takeaway here is to understand the memory hierarchy. SSDs
are fast, but RAM is faster. CPU cache is the fastest. The gap has 
diminished, but still exists.
* Video #20-21, Files & File Systems - Compression:
These two are less important yet insightful. You'll learn the
basics of how images (RGB pixels) and other files are encoded,
and the basics of compression. Compression is a neat topic that
will later help you understand the speed-memory-accuracy trade-offs.
* Video #26, Graphical User Interfaces:
GUIs are not too widespread in Data Science but getting the hang of
how they work (Event-Driven Programming) and learning how
to create one yourself will pay off later.
* Video #27, 3D Graphics:
If you're planning on going into Computer Vision, this is perhaps
the most important video of the series. Learning about projections
is useful for AR/VR applications, as well as many common CV tasks.
* Videos #34-37: Our bread and butter.

### Udemy (paid)

Generally, the quality of courses in udemy is not very high. You can still find variations, but I would generally not go into that.
Also, courses are paid, but with coupons and promotions (which you can easily find) the price for each course is $10-15 (don't pay
the "full" prices, there is always some promo code lying around).

#### 1) [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)

Portilla is a good instructor, and has a solid understanding of the math. This particular course is a very comprehensive (in breadth,
not depth) introduction to machine learning. More or less, he follows the contents of the book: "Introduction to Statistical Learning,
with Applications in R". This course has "projects" (more like exercises), which are not graded. You can optionally solve them, and
there are solution videos. There is also a forum with lots of Q&As. It is not a mathematically rigorous course, but you get to view
how to use the most important libraries for Data Science, and the first ~10 sections are about programming introductions to libraries,
e.g.: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy. Again, ~20 hours, which you can safely view in 1.25-1.5x speed. I've only checked a few
"exercises" but they seem to be okay.

#### 2) [The complete SQL Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/)

Again Portilla, this time less than 10 hours. In the same spirit as above, it is a quick introduction to SQL, using Postgre as a
backend. I didn't find this course as good as the previous one. For one, a lot of introductory stuff were omitted, and more advanced
stuff was never mentioned. It is about average in terms of introduction to handling SQL, and has a few videos on interfacing it with
Python. I found this course severely lacking in terms of theory. No explanations of the internals of databases (e.g. binary tree
variants), no explanation on how computers handle data (e.g. memory vs storage), not much of good coding practices and how to structure
databases (duplication, models, etc). From a practitioner point of view, I might recommend this one, but I'd rather go into a more
detailed course about the theoretical underpinnings of databases before I get into code. **I should stress out that SQL is easy and
can easily be picked up in a day (or week) just by reading the commands and viewing examples.**

#### 3) [Zero to Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/zero-to-deep-learning/)

I was very disappointed. The course is not that great, and although Portilla is mentioned, he's not the one teaching. Before moving on
let me point out that it is incomplete in many ways. Firstly, some lectures are missing, and secondly, probably whole sections need
to be added as well. Practise and exercises were simply not enough, explanations weren't deep, supplementary material (i.e. readings)
was not added. Not explaining Keras docs is one thing (reading the documentation is easy after all) but not going into more detail
about NN was another. The worst point was that there was no indication of what technique is better applicaple where, and what are
the necessary conditions for each technique. Despite earlier remarks about expecting more of J.M.Portilla, Francesco Mosconi was okay.
One of positive aspects of the course was that he seems knowledgeable, but maybe he takes some things for granted (which I, coming
from a non-science background, probably wouldn't know - and I didn't back then) and that's why explanations didn't seem deep enough ("why does this run slower
than that?", "where can I get data?", "what does cross-validation do that the test set doesn't?", and hundreds more that may or may
not be insignificant).
