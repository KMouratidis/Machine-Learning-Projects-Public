### MIT OpenCourseWare (free)

#### 1) [MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2010](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi)

This is an introduction to AI, but the title of "introduction" is somewhat misleading as to the fact that it presupposes some knowledge.
You'll find a ton of information, especially on more traditional approaches to field. The most notable one is the use of "search"
algorithms (i.e. that search for solutions in a "state space"; depth/breadth first search, A-star, Beam-search, Branch-and-Bound).
The professor doesn't go into too much detail about every subject (it *is* an introduction after all). I you are interested in
implementing some of these algorithms drop me a message and I can give you an exercise I played around with (playing Freecell
Solitaire). He mentions the basic of other advanced subjects (**Neural Nets, Edge Detection -Computer vision-, Phonology,
Genetic Algorithms, Statistical/Machine Learning, Belief Nets**). It might be hard to follow some of the topics, but he stresses
the concepts more than the mathematics, so that's good. It takes about 24 hours, but you can skip (although I'd advise against)
the last 7 videos since they are not actual lectures. You can easily watch the whole series at 1.25-1.5 speed, maybe even 2x.
The professor is very passionate and has also prepared a lot of visual demonstrations.

#### 2) [MIT 6.0002 Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science, Fall 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP619EG1wp0kT-7rDE_Az5TNd)

This course is a general introduction to Data Science, and covers the most important topics like Statistics (inference and 
probability), Optimization and the basics of Machine Learning. Again, it is more focused on a few key ideas.
It will walk you through some examples, and will focus on solving problems with code rather than math (which I believe is the
best approach). Both professors are excellent and most lectures are quite fun to watch.

### Coursera (free / paid)

#### 1) [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

Machine Learning by Andrew Ng is maybe the most popular Machine Learning introduction course out there. As with most of the previous
courses, I breezed through the lectures quickly (again, 1.5x is easy to do for anyone). It goes into the mathematics, but doesn't
get bogged down. He shows a bit of code, but the languages that he's using are MATLAB and Octave. The first is popular (and paid),
but the second is not really used by Data Scientists (everyone goes with Python or R).  This still covers a wide variety of topics
and Andrew Ng is a *great* professor (also cofounder of Coursera).

#### 2) [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

That is not the case for Andrew Ng's Deep Learning course. I took this specialization (4 courses at the time, now 5) about 9 months
ago, and I have to say it is probably the best introduction to Deep Learning. It has graded exercises if you opt for the verified
track (~$40-50 per month), which I suggest doing, and great lectures. The professor goes into much detail but doesn't get bogged down
in neither the mathematics (not too much to begin with) nor the coding (that's where the exercises come in). The coding part of
Neural Nets is hard, but this is not the case for this course since there are many prompts (too many, to be honest) in the exercises,
and thus you know what you have to do (some bugs when I first completed it, but they'll probably have been fixed by now).
Overall, I cannot recommend this specialization enough. There are lots of people who successfully completed it. When it comes
to time, back then it took me less than a month for the 4 courses. Experienced people in Deep Learning that only did the exercises
could finish one course per day (I assume they also had jobs). I don't recommend rushing it. Contrary to what I did at the time,
I insist you take your time and read some papers and complementary material, just to get a better view of the field.

### Udemy (paid)

Generally, the quality of courses in udemy is not very high. You can still find variations, but I would generally not go into that.
Also, courses are paid, but with coupons and promotions (which you can easily find) the price for each course is $10-15 (don't pay
the "full" prices, there is always some promo code lying around).

#### 1) [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)

Portilla is a good instructor, and has a solid understanding of the math. This particular course is a very comprehensive (in breadth,
not depth) introduction to machine learning. More or less, he follows the contents of the book: "Introduction to Statistical Learning,
with Applications in R". This course has "projects" (more like exercises), which are not graded. You can optionally solve them, and
there are solution videos. There is also a forum with lots of Q&As. It is not a mathematically rigorous course, but you get to view
how to use the most important libraries for Data Science, and the first ~10 sections are about programming introductions to libraries,
e.g.: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy. Again, ~20 hours, which you can safely view in 1.25-1.5x speed. I've only checked a few
"exercises" but they seem to be okay.

#### 2) [The complete SQL Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/)

Again Portilla, this time less than 10 hours. In the same spirit as above, it is a quick introduction to SQL, using Postgre as a
backend. I didn't find this course as good as the previous one. For one, a lot of introductory stuff were omitted, and more advanced
stuff was never mentioned. It is about average in terms of introduction to handling SQL, and has a few videos on interfacing it with
Python. I found this course severely lacking in terms of theory. No explanations of the internals of databases (e.g. binary tree
variants), no explanation on how computers handle data (e.g. memory vs storage), not much of good coding practices and how to structure
databases (duplication, models, etc). From a practitioner point of view, I might recommend this one, but I'd rather go into a more
detailed course about the theoretical underpinnings of databases before I get into code. **I should stress out that SQL is easy and
can easily be picked up in a day (or week) just by reading the commands and viewing examples.**

#### 3) [Zero to Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/zero-to-deep-learning/)

I was very disappointed. The course is not that great, and although Portilla is mentioned, he's not the one teaching. Before moving on
let me point out that it is incomplete in many ways. Firstly, some lectures are missing, and secondly, probably whole sections need
to be added as well. Practise and exercises were simply not enough, explanations weren't deep, supplementary material (i.e. readings)
was not added. Not explaining Keras docs is one thing (reading the documentation is easy after all) but not going into more detail
about NN was another. The worst point was that there was no indication of what technique is better applicaple where, and what are
the necessary conditions for each technique. Despite earlier remarks about expecting more of J.M.Portilla, Francesco Mosconi was okay.
One of positive aspects of the course was that he seems knowledgeable, but maybe he takes some things for granted (which I, coming
from a non-science background, probably wouldn't know - and I didn't back then) and that's why explanations didn't seem deep enough ("why does this run slower
than that?", "where can I get data?", "what does cross-validation do that the test set doesn't?", and hundreds more that may or may
not be insignificant).
