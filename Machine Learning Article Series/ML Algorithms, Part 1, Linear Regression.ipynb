An excellent book for those who want a bit more depth is the widely popular *An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Application in R* by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani, from the *Springer Texts in Statistics* series. I will try to be as short as possible so I will inevitably omit some details. This series of articles also assumes some basic familiarity with programming."
